To get a better idea of the plugin, <a href="http://www.datafeedr.com/video/?id=random-ads">watch the video introduction (3:51)</a>.

How does it work?

Let's say you have 3 banner ads that you want to randomly appear in your header. One ad is Google Adsense, one is an affiliate banner and one is an ad for your own site.

Just add the code snippet for each ad to a text file, separate each ad with the pipe "|" symbol and add a function call to your template file. Now, a random ad will be shown in your header.

You can also easily add ads to your sidebar using the built-in widget.
